# Shoe Inventory Management System

This Python program manages a shoe inventory system with the following features:

- Read shoe data from a file called `inventory.txt`.
- Add new shoes to the inventory.
- View all available shoes in a nicely formatted table.
- Restock the shoe with the lowest quantity.
- Search for shoes using their product code.
- Calculate the total value of each shoe type.
- Identify the shoe with the highest quantity available for sale.

The data is stored and updated in `inventory.txt`. The program uses object-oriented programming principles with a `Shoe` class, and provides a simple interactive menu for user interaction.
